# SoundSystem

This Is an alternative way of fetching sound, Instead of directly calling It you call it by its Unique name. Makes fetching sound alot easier than directly searching a Folder.

Also, this only Creates the Sound when You ask It too. Its stored in a table and gets reconstructed when the sound is requested.

Added some background music and clickable buttons to generally show how it works.
